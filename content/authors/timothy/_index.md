Timothy is a senior studying psychology. Born in Virginia, he moved to Philadelphia to
attend school at Temple University. Timothy aims to earn a Masterâ€™s in Clinical Psychology
and is always looking to expand his skill set and capabilities. He thinks R can be intimidating but rewarding for new users and hopes his slides tutorial can help students.
