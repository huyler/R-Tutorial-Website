Peyton Coleman is a senior at Temple studying Neuroscience with a minor in Music. She started out in music therapy and has now decided to research the interactions that music has with the brain. She works as a research technician at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in the Davidson Neurogenetics Lab, and she will be attending Vanderbilt University in the fall of 2020 to pursue her doctorate in neuroscience, music, and genetics.
