My name is Preston and I am a junior Psychology major at Temple university. I was born and raised in Philadelphia. I plan on going to graduate school for my Psy.D to practice clinical psychology. R can be challenging, but the benefits are totally worth it. The best way to get your feet wet is to read through the tutorials on our website. Get coding!
